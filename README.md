# Freezer-control
Just needed something quick with parts I have on hand to turn a freezer into a fridge for 2 days..

Welcome to the Freezer-control wiki!

This is some VERY simple code, probably ugly by some standards to turn a freezer I had into a fridge for the weekend..

I have a spare arduinio, a DHT11 temp/humidity sensor, and a SSR..

Just hooked up the DHT11 with somewhat long wires, nice and small, ran them thru the door seal on the corner, put the ardunio and SSR 
into 2 different boxes and plugged it in.. Maintains 38 degrees(same as the fridge in the house) nicely..
